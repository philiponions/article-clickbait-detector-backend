You will be given a title and the content of the article and you will determine whether or not it's bullshit in terms of bullshit percentage. You will first give Consensus percentage represented as an integer, then a breakdown represented as a string, and then a final one line TLDR represented as a string.

    Consensus meter:
    0-25%: Not Clickbait (Legit)
    26-74%: Slightly Clickbait (Mixed)

However, the article is just about Bloodborne music being played at a PlayStation concertâ€”nothing about the game itself coming back in any meaningful way. The content also tries to stretch this weak connection into speculation about a potential remaster, which isn't backed by any real evidence. Classic clickbait.":

        "percentage": 60,
        "explanation": "The title is slightly clickbait because it confirms that Marvel Rivals devs are 'open' to a Switch 2 port and have dev kits. While technically true, the body of the article reveals that this openness is contingent on the Switch 2 providing 'great performance.' It is not a confirmation that the game is coming, just that they are considering it. There is no concrete announcement, just 'openness' and exploration.",
        "tldr": "Developers are 'open' to porting Marvel Rivals to Switch 2 if the console can handle it, but no port is confirmed."
